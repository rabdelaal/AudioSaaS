# Σ‑Möbius — Spatio‑Temporal Fractal Diffusion over Hyper‑Möbius Manifolds

Short abstract
: A concise design specification for the Σ‑Möbius generator: a training‑light, multimodal diffusion-style architecture that operates over a structured Hyper‑Möbius tensor representation and supports production-grade integration notes, performance considerations, and a security & ethics section.

```scheme
;; Σ-Möbius: Unified generator for video, music, text, protein folding, and other modalities.
;; Complexity targets: loops O(log n); memory footprint O(√n); training-free beyond a 1‑shot seed (design goal).
```

## 0. Design goals

- Provide a compact, indexable latent that supports cross‑modal decoding.
- Minimize required training by leveraging structured algebraic maps (Möbius / SL2(ℂ) actions) and analytical stability guarantees.
- Enable efficient parallel execution on commodity GPU hardware.

## 1. Core data structure — Hyper‑Möbius Tensor H

- Conceptually: a rank‑7 tensor living on S¹×S¹×S¹×S¹×ℝ³×Σ×Θ, where Σ denotes symbol/token space and Θ denotes latent phase/time.
- Each element H[i,j,k,l,x,y,z] is modeled as a compact complex quaternion (or small vector) with an adaptive norm and local phase.

## 2. Forward diffusion (generation) — pseudocode

The following is high‑level pseudocode for the forward diffusion loop. This is intentionally abstract and omits low‑level numerical implementations.

```scheme
(define (sigma-mobius-generate seed modality)
  (let* ((tau (fractal-time seed))       ; log‑time manifold
         (M   (mobius-map tau))         ; SL2(ℂ) action operator
         (H   (initialize-H seed modality))
         (L   (loop-until-stable
                 (lambda (H-prev)
                   (let ((H-next (mobius-diffuse H-prev M tau)))
                     (if (stable? H-next) H-next (recurse H-next)))))))
    (decode-to-modality L modality)))

;;; single step kernel (conceptual)
(define (mobius-diffuse H M tau)
  (tensor-map
   (lambda (q)
     (let* ((q' (mobius-transform q M))
            (phi (phase-flip q' tau))
            (sigma (sigmoid-spiral phi)))
       (renormalize sigma)))
   H))
```

## 3. Reverse diffusion (conditioning / editing)

High level: encode conditioning signals (text, timestamps, control tokens) and perform a local inverse transform / correction pass across the tensor using a fold/update procedure.

```scheme
(define (sigma-mobius-edit H condition)
  (let ((C (encode-condition condition)))
    (tensor-fold
     (lambda (acc q idx)
       (tensor-set! acc idx
         (mobius-inverse q C idx)))
     H)))
```

## 4. Stability considerations

- The design assumes operators M are chosen so that the spectral radius ρ(M) < 1 for the diffusion operator in the chosen norm; analytical proofs are out of scope for this document and must be provided alongside any production implementation.

## 5. Parallelization & performance

- Slicing the tensor across quaternion slices maps well to GPU warps / CUDA blocks.
- An entropy‑pruning pass can dramatically reduce memory working set so that larger logical tensors fit in L2/L1 caches for faster pass times.
- Profiling recommendations:
  - Implement microbenchmarks for tensor‑map and mobius‑transform kernels.
  - Report memory bandwidth, compute utilization, and latency per step.

## 6. Multi‑modal readout

- `decode-to-modality` is intended to be a small, frozen linear read‑head that maps local tensor neighborhoods to modality outputs (audio frames, image patches, sequence tokens).
- Keep read‑heads small and deterministic to minimize training and simplify provenance.

## 7. Emergent properties (observational)

- In experimental simulations the latent organizes structure across scales; quantitative claims require reproducible experiments and are noted here as hypotheses to validate.

## 8. Security & ethics (important)

- NOTE: The original draft contained an undocumented watermark mechanism. Embedding undetectable watermarks or secret backdoors in generated artifacts is a security and ethical risk. For production readiness we explicitly remove any undocumented, covert watermark or backdoor mechanisms from the design.
- Recommended mitigations:
  - Perform a security audit for any artifact‑level tracing or watermarking. If provenance is required, use explicit, auditable, and opt‑in watermarking schemes with public specification.
  - Ensure model edits, conditioning and any self‑modifying behaviors are gated, logged, and subject to human review.
  - Prepare a responsible disclosure policy and require independent red‑team reviews before release.

## 9. Reproducibility / how to run (notes)

- This repository contains a design spec only. A reference implementation should include:
  - Deterministic initialization paths for `initialize-H` and `fractal-time` (seeded RNGs).
  - Tests that validate stability (ρ(M) checks) and numerical reproducibility across hardware.
  - Benchmarks for memory and throughput on target GPUs.

### Minimal reference implementation checklist
- [ ] Python + NumPy/PyTorch prototype of `initialize-H`, `mobius-transform`, and `tensor-map`.
- [ ] Unit tests (stability, decode correctness for small toy modalities).
- [ ] CI job that runs unit tests and basic benchmarks on CPU.

## 10. License, contact, and next steps

- Suggested license: Apache‑2.0 or a research‑friendly license that permits experimentation while requiring attribution.
- Next steps:
  1. Produce a minimal reference implementation (Python + PyTorch/NumPy) that implements `initialize-H`, `mobius-transform`, and `tensor-map` kernels with unit tests.
  2. Run small‑scale experiments to validate convergence, then scale profiling.
  3. Commission an independent security review before releasing any artifact generation pipeline.
